  - Updated all dynamic API routes: `/api/requests/[id]`, `/api/requests/[id]/tasks`, `/api/requests/[id]/tasks/[taskId]`
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in `utils/api.ts` (removed `any` types, proper Zod import, better error handling)
  - Verified all endpoints return 200 status codes without async params errors
- **TasksDataService Test Stabilization**: Resolved critical test failures and improved test reliability
  - Fixed "Data integrity check failed after write" errors by improving crypto module mocking

  - Verified CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete for both requests and tasks
  - Confirmed data integrity features: file locking, backup creation, atomic operations, checksum verification
  - Tested complete workflow: task creation → updating → persistence → deletion
  - Validated proper error responses (404 for missing resources)
  - Confirmed TasksDataService singleton pattern and file operations working correctly
- **Copilot Instructions Enhancement**: Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project-specific guidance
